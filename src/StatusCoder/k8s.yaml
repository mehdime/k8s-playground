# We're creating two Kubernetes objects here:
#
# 1. A Service: this sits in front our our pods, has its own IP address and takes care of routing traffic to any 
#    of our running pods. A load balancer effectively.
#
# 2. A Deployment: this is the description of how we want to deploy our app on K8S: i.e.: what docker image we want to use,
#    how many replicas we want, etc.

  selector:
    app: statuscoder # Set to the label that we gave our pods (see the Deployment spec below). This is how this service knows which pods it should route traffic too. 
  ports:
  - targetPort: 5100 # The port that our app is listening to in the pods (i.e. the port that our ASP.NET app has been configured with)
    port: 30000 # The port that will be exposed within the K8S cluster. Other apps inside the cluster must connect to that port to access our app. 
    nodePort: 30000 # The port that will be exposed outside of the K8S cluster. That's what we can use to access the service from e.g. the local machine. By default, nodePort must be in the 30000-32767 range. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport
